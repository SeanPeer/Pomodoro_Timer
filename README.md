# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a simple yet effective Pomodoro Timer built with Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application implements this technique, allowing users to focus on their tasks with regular breaks to boost productivity and maintain mental agility.

## Features

- **Customizable Timer Settings**: Set work, short break, and long break durations to fit your personal productivity rhythm.
- **Auto-Start Sessions**: Work and break sessions automatically start after the previous one ends, following the Pomodoro Technique cycles.
- **Visual and Text Indicators**: The application provides visual cues for different sessions (work, short break, long break) and updates the countdown in real-time.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Timer**: Click the "START" button to begin the Pomodoro cycle. The timer will start with the predefined work duration.
2. **Taking Breaks**: After a work session ends, the timer automatically starts a short break. Every 4th break will be a long break.
3. **Resetting the Timer**: If you need to start over or adjust the timer, simply click the "RESET" button. This will stop the current session and reset the timer to 00:00.
